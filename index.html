<b>Translation</b>: it’s the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The final product is a readable, accurate and natural new original.
<p>
 
<p>
<b>Rewieving</b> (also known as Editing): it’s the monolingual review of the target-language text against the source-language text in order to correct any errors and improve the style, if need be. A careful check of the translation is provided for overall quality, suitability for purpose, terminology consistency, style and register.The main goal is to assess the suitability of the final translation for the agreed purpose.

<b>Proofreading</b>: it’s checking a typeset copy before printing to ensure that no mistakes have been introduced in translated documents in the process of formatting and typesetting.

<p>
<b>Audio/Video Transcription</b>: it’s the process of converting audio and video formats to text. This means listening to an audio or video recording and then typing it as a written transcript.
